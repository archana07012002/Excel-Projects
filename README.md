## ✨Key Features & Actionable Insights
The Dashboard is designed for clarity and fast analysis, featuring:
### 📊Performance Scorecards
At-a-glance metrics for the entire year:
- Total Calls: 1,000
- Total Amount (Revenue): $96,623
- Total Duration: 89,850 minutes
- Average Rating: 3.9(out of 5.0)
- Happy Callers: 307
### 📉Operational Trends
- Monthly Call Trend: A line graph that instantly highlights peak months (e.g., March) and low-volume periods, crucial for staffing decisions.
- Daily Distribution: Bar charts showing call volume by day of the week (e.g., confirming Saturday's status as the busiest day).

## 👥Demographic & Satisfaction analysis
- Female vs. Male Callers: A comparative view of call volume and distribution across major centers (Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus).
- Customer Rating Distribution: A histogram showing the frequency of rating (1-5). The high volume of rating 4 and 5 indicates strong satisfaction, while lower ratings pinpoint areas needing training.

## 🔎Detailed Ranking & Revenue Breakdown (Interactive)
This section is the analytical core, featuring interactive filtering:
- Agent/Category Ranks (R01-R05): Side-by-side charts visualize the total Calls and Amount generated by five distinct performance categories (Ranks, Regions, or Focus Areas). This helps in quickly identifying the top-performing rank/region.
- Focus Area Drilldown (F01-F05): A slicer/filter allows users to switch between five distinct Focus Areas (F01 through F05).
  - The detailed table below updates to show how specific Call IDs (C0001, C0002, etc.) in each city performed in the selected Focus Area. For example, selecting F03 shows exactly which agents excelled in that area.
